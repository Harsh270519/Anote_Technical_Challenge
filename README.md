# Anote_Technical_Challenge

For the technical challenge, I fine tuned on LLM on a combination of datasets namely the the Finance Bench and RAG Instruct.
Since the task was question and answering, I decided to go with decoder only models
Considering the computational requirements, I fine-tuned Mistral using LoRA. 
The training data was passed in the form of instructional fine tuning
